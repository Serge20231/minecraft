# Define the block types and their applied offsets that will act as hang rails
# For each type the block and offset settings can be configured
# Legacy block data can be specified using a colon (:), for example 'WOOL:RED'
# Similarly, to specify all data variants of a legacy type, you can use 'WOOL:'
# Running on Minecraft 1.13 and later, new material names may replace legacy ones
# Omitting data means data of the block is ignored entirely
# The offset is up/down relative to the block. >0=above, <0=below
# The sign offset is up/down relative to the block trains see signs
# The sign direction specifies in what direction trains look for signs for this rails
# A sign direction of SELF (default) uses UP/DOWN based on the offset of the Minecart
# 
# Example configuration:
# types:
#   - block: IRON_FENCE
#     offset: -2
#     signOffset: 0
#     signDirection: SELF
#   - block: WOOL:RED
#     offset: 1
#     signOffset: 0
#     signDirection: DOWN
types:
  - block: IRON_FENCE
    offset: -2
    signOffset: 0
    signDirection: SELF
